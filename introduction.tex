%Statistical Learning Problems in general 


%Sequential decision making =/= eg. clustering
\par Consider the problem of a clinical trial where several new drugs are tested to replace an existing drug. The most simple experimental framework would be to assign a fixed number of patients to the new drugs.  As new patients join the experiment they are allocated to one of the drugs until each has the required number of patients. If one of the drugs can be ruled to be ineffective with relatively high confidence early in the test, shouldn't we stop assigning patients to it in favour of the others? The key medical ethic ``do no harm'' would suggest that we should seek to find the most effective flexible procedure to ensure we do not needlessly put patients at risk in clinical trials.
